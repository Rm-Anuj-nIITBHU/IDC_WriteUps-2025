**Statement** - \
I just finished building my first website using ReactJS! To make it prettier, I asked my trustworthy AI assistant to edit the UI, but it seems to have accidentally exposed something it shouldn’t have…

Thankfully, I always use encrypted flags.. and no one knows my favorite number, right? 😅

https://react-ctf.vercel.app/

**Points** - 100

**FLAG** - IDC{d1d_y0u_l1k3_my_r34c7_w3b5173_fr13r3n}

**SOLUTION** - \
- Open the link provided in the statement(Avoid the Hint button!!!). \ 
- Click the button with click counter 1000 times (Or click on it once and hold enter or space). \ 
- When the counter reaches 1000, the flag will be revealed. 
	
**Core concept** - AES encryption and REACT based web page.
