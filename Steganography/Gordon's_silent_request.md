**Statement** 
While I was cutting some delicious looking bread at the skit called Hell's Cafeteria , chef Ramsay came in anger took two slices of my beautiful bread and put in on either side of the face of Julie Chen , but after touching my slices of bread , chef ramsay couldn't hold back and clicked a picture of me slicing the bread. Then VOILA at the end of the day he DM'ed me that exact same picture. What could he possibly tell me ??..ughhh find that for me love, UwU 😘
