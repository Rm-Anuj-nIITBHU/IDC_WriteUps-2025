**SOLUTION**
	- Download the p3p3.png file which is actually an apng or animated png file.
	- Download the 'apngdis' software using command 'apt install apngdis'.
	- Use apngdis to disassemble the frames of the animation using the command 'apngdis /path/to/p3p3.png'.
	- This will extract the frames and a corresponding text file conatining the delay time of each frame.
	- Note down the delay of each frame to obtain "73 68 67 123 112 51 80 101 95 116 72 105 53 95 105 115 95 52 80 78 71 125".
