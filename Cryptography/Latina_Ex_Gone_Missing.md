**Statement** - \
My ex was a huge fan of the Mandalorians From Star Wars series— for her, they represented what a real man should be. Every night, after I fell asleep, she used to talk to them. Whenever I asked about it, she’d go silent and bury herself in her favorite MAROKABA notebook. 
\
Me, being illiterate, never understood what she was studying. Maybe I should’ve paid more attention… 
\
Now, she’s gone missing.
\
All I have left is her notebook — filled with strange writings.
\
Help me find her!
