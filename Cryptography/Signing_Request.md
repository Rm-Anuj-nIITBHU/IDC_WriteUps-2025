**Statement** - \
I got a certificate from my principal for being the school’s best comedian, but she pulled a prank and didn’t sign it 😭. Now I have to get her signature, but being the ultimate couch potato, I really don’t want to drag myself to her office. So, I just slid my request into a file instead!

**Points** - 50 

**FLAG** - IDC{M4am_pl3aSe_SigN_my_Cer7ifIc4t3}

**SOLUTION** - \ 
- Download the file provided in the statement.
- Open it as a text file using any text editor.
- Copy the cypher text and decode using base64 from any dcode.fr or cyberchef.io.
- Flag can be found in the decrypted text.

--Alternative Method (That I found out later)--
- Change the extension of the file from .jpg to .pem and open it.
- It will open as a certificate file with the flag as its Common Name.

**Core concept** - Certificate file.
