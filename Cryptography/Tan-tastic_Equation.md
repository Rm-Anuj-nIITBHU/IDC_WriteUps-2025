**Statement** - \ 
The decimals whisper secrets, but only the tangent listens.
Multiply the scream by a thousand, then snatch the low bits.
Absolute tantrums only — the sign is lying to you.
Each byte hides in plain sight; many pi-steps will lead you astray.
Dare to reverse the spiral: given the byte, conjure the coordinate.
Precision is your ally, chaos is your canvas.
Decode the hidden song — the flag waits at the tip of your tangent.
