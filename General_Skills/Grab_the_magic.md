**Statement** 
A baba gave me this ZIP file on the ghats and told me that there is magic in this file. When consulted why this file is huge , he went on to say something else was also very huge 😔....... the saddness in the world duhhh and he went on to smoke more of the stuff he got in his pipe , IDK what it was 😉. Help me find the magic 🦄

**SOLUTION**
	- Extract the provided file 'stuff.zip' in any desired folder.
	- Open the Terminal and change directory to the above folder using command 'cd /path/to/directory'.
	- Use the command 'grep -r "IDC" .'.
	- This gives all occurances of the string IDC in all text files in the folder.
	- There are many fake flags, try all to find the right one (or guess by the term "m4g1c").
	
**Core concpet** grep command to find strings in text files.
